## Inspiration
After a lot of brainstorming, we realized that traditional art forms like Kolam are slowly fading away due to lack of awareness and proper learning platforms. Today, most learners who wish to explore Kolam, Rangoli, or similar cultural art forms face difficulties such as:

Lack of structured learning resources in one place.

Limited access to experts or artists who can teach the authentic methods.

No interactive, personalized, or multilingual platforms that can help learners practice Kolam patterns in a systematic way.
## What it does
AnantaKolam provides learners and art enthusiasts with proper guidance and structure to learn, practice, and excel in traditional Kolam art forms.
It helps users in their Kolam journey with:
Generate and explore different Kolam styles (Pulli, Sikku, Rangoli, Floral, etc.) with customizable grid sizes.
Learn from expert artists through guided sessions and personalized mentorship.
Practice and create Kolam step by step in an interactive and engaging way.
Access everything in their own local language, making Kolam learning inclusive and accessible to all
